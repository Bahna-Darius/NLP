# LORA
## Lora is a technique that adjusts a base model (a large model) instead of re-training the large model which would generate enormous costs and time we apply lora which adds some extra layers specific to our problem
## The PHI-2 model knows everything but for our product description task it doesn't have great knowledge, so with lora we applied this knowledge to specialize on this part as well, modifying only a small number of parameters.
In conclusion:

The Phi-2 model is like a big encyclopedia that knows a lot about language.

LoRA is like a series of quick notes that tells the model to specialize only on product descriptions, without having to redo the whole encyclopedia.
